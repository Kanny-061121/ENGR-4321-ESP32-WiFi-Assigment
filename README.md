# ENGR-4321-ESP32-WiFi-Assigment
Wi-Fi connectivity on embedded systems, client-server interaction

This project is a simulation on Wokwi for SunFounder Tutorial 8.6 – Temperature & Humidity Monitoring with Adafruit IO

This project uses:
- ESP32
- DHT11/DHT22 Sensor
- 220 Ohm Resistor
- LED
- Adafruit IO Cloud Dashboard

The connection of the circuit can be observed in the Diagram

Features:
- Reads temperature & humidity
- Sends data to Adafruit IO
- Displays live charts on dashboard

The following images shows the simulation interacting with Adafruit. The status of the LED can be changed wirelessly. The LED was turned on and OFF by pressing the analog switch on the dashbord in Adafruit.
